Best, weirdest 70-minute review of The Phantom Menace ever
https://archive.is/Gktk0 (scifiwire.com)

This is so weird and long and perceptive that it's awesome.
It's a seven-part, 70-minute one-man critique of the first Star Wars prequel film, Episode Iâ€”The Phantom Menace (or so it seems), intercut with random bits of film and video footage and delivered in a geeky monotone that is completely on the money for the most part.
It also ends up being a short history of the movies and of the work and career of George Lucas, as well as a satire about reviews and critiques themselves.
AND watch it all the way through: We learn that this reviewer isn't exactly playing with a full deck, and the film has a heck of a surprise ending.

It's captured the imaginations of Tweeters from Simon Pegg to Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof, and we bring the first part to you and recommend you check the rest out at YouTube.com.
Here's the official description from Mike, the guy who created it and who runs Red Letter Media out of Milwaukee, Wis.:

Finally it's here!
The truly epic review/critique/analysis/film making educational video of the 1999 film "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"
There was so much to discuss with this film it had to be long so please don't complain.
If you think it's too long then don't watch it.
In this opening segment I discuss the major flaw of The Phantom Menace which is the characters and the lack of connection with the audience.
Here's a sample quote: "Star Wars the Phantom Menace was the most disappointing thing since my son. I mean how much could you f--k up the entire backstory of Star Wars?"

So...what do you think?
