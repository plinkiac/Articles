Let me say right off the bat that I understand 70 minutes is a long time.
In fact, it is half the run-time of the film itself.
I felt the same way when a friend first sent it to me, but, trust me, it is well worth it.

Posted by YouTube user RedLetterMedia this is an hour and ten minute reflection and review of the epic shit storm that was Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
But, trust me, it is unlike any review you have ever seen.
Narrated by a man who sounds strangely similar to Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs, the first line of the seven part series is "Star Wars The Phantom Menace was more disappointing than my son," and it only gets stranger from there.
Breaking down the film scene by scene, exploring Qui-Gon Jinn's secret drinking problem, the complete and utter uselessness of battle droids and the fact that kids ruin everything, there is not a line or continuity error that sneaks by him.
It should also be mentioned that the narrator is a complete fucking lunatic who is keeping a female prisoner in his basement and kills prostitutes with Raid, but that is really just a side plot.

Carve out some time in your busy day and be sure to watch it all the way through.
It even gets a bit deep by the end.
Did I mention that it's Simon Pegg-Approved?
Check it out below.
