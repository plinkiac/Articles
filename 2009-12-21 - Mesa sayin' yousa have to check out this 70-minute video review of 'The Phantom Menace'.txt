This is a few days old, but if you haven’t checked out this 70-minute review of The Phantom Menace, then you’re a menace to all the Star Wars: Episode I haters out there.
Need an additional reason to sit through an hour-plus review?
The series of awesome YouTube videos — made by a man named “Mike” in Milwaukee — won the approval of Lost and Star Trek‘s Damon Lindelof, who reportedly said about the review, “Your life is about to change. This is astounding film making. Watch ALL of it.”
So sit back and watch all of this slightly NSFW 70-minute review about the film that “Mike” says “was the most disappointing thing since my son.”
(Part 1 is embedded below.)
Enjoy!
