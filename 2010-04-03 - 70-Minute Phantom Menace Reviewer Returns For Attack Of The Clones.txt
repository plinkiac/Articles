70-Minute Phantom Menace Reviewer Returns For Attack Of The Clones

Late last year, a video review of the film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was posted on YouTube by a user named RedLetterMedia.
This was no ordinary review.
Rather it was an 80-minute assault that analyzed both the film itself and the process that went into making it, largely criticizing the people around George Lucas who were unwilling to say anything that could be labeled as contrary to the director's vision.
It wasn't the long-form criticism that made it unique, though.
It was the fact that it was written and narrated by a psychotic serial killer who kept a woman chained up in his basement and had a strange affliction for pizza rolls.
Now he's back for more.

That's right: RedLetterMedia is back with his review of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of The Clones.
The bad news is that it's not here in its entirety just yet.
Parts one through three of what will be a series of nine videos have been posted so far today, all going over 10 minutes.
I'm sure that many of you will be waiting until the entire series is posted to start watching, but you can be assured that we will add the videos to this post as the user does.
Until then, feel free to revisit the first review or check out his slightly shorter - 20 minute - review of Avatar.
