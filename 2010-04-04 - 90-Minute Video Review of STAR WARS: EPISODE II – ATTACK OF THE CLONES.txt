After his wildly successful 70-minute video review of The Phantom Menace, Red Letter Media has returned with a 90-minute review of Attack of the Clones.
While RLM was able to get through the plot of the first movie, this time around he focuses more on the uncomfortable “romance” and the terrible action sequences.
But like the first mega-review, he points out a lot of inconsistencies and contradictions I never noticed or at least forced myself to forget.

This is definitely going to be a more controversial installment when it comes to his points about what women want in a guy, why Samuel L. Jackson was cast in the film, and that it’s possible to have too many lightsabers.
Whether you agree or not, well...that’s why we have a comments section.
(But I hope we all agree he needs to drop the lame serial killer stuff)
