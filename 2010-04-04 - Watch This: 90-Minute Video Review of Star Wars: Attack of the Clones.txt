Watch This: 90-Minute Video Review of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones
http://www.slashfilm.com/90-minute-star-wars-attack-of-the-clones-video-review/

Mike from Red Letter Media (AKA the guy who put together the epic, 70-minute review of The Phantom Menace) is back again with his even epic-er review of Attack of the Clones.
This time, seven Youtube videos were insufficient to contain the hatred, so Mike spread out a 90-minute review over nine Youtube videos.
See them all after the break, and let the hate flow through you.
