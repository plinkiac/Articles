Plinkett Defends Movie Remakes With the (Old) New Star Trek Movie
https://archive.is/fZKe8 (techland.time.com)

We make no qualms about worshipping at the altar of Harry Plinkett, film reviewer for Red Letter Media.

He’s back with a new review for 2009’s Star Trek.
Yeah, the movie’s been out of the theaters for quite some time, but no one does it better than Plinkett (real name: Mike Stoklasa) when it comes to berating what’s at the movies.
The review is pretty lengthy  – did I mention it runs almost 70 minutes? – so after you’re done ooo-ing and ahh-ing over all those new Apple products, you might as well watch it.
Apple 2G TV isn’t going to ship for four weeks anyway.
Plus, he’s changed it up by actually liking this one, although he did previously suggest that this version raped a woman.

You could either:
A) Watch the review
B) Watch the movie (but if you haven’t seen it by now, you probably need to get out more)
C) Spend some time outdoors enjoying the last days of summer

We’re ticking off choice A.
Chances are you saw Star Trek in IMAX and in SD in the theaters, on top of repeated home viewings of your Blu-ray copy.
And, that pollen in the air is just horrible for your allergies, and that sun burns when it touches your alabaster skin.
Make sure to enjoy his rant with some pizza rolls.
