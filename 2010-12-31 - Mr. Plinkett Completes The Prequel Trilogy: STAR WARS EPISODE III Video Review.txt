Mr. Plinkett Completes The Prequel Trilogy: STAR WARS EPISODE III Video Review

Hot on the heels of Javier Grillo-Marxauch talking about his year without Star Wars comes the long-awaited Red Letter Media review of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.
Red Letter Media (and the character of Mr. Plinkett) have been working their way through the Prequel Trilogy for some time now, and we’ve been on pins and needles waiting to see what he would make of the last film.

There are some who think these video reviews are just more hating on Star Wars; they’re not.
They’re very funny but very correct deconstructions of the films.
Plinkett is smart (while reveling in stupid humor) and he dismantles the films from intelligent positions, as well as from some nitpicky geek positions.

This latest video is loooong - almost two hours!
Plinkett really goes in-depth.
I haven’t watched the whole thing yet, but I like the first part that I’ve seen.
I’m excited to dig in to the rest later today.
