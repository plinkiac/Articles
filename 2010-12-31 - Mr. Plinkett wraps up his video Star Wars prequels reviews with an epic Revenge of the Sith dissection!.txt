Mr. Plinkett wraps up his video Star Wars prequels reviews with an epic Revenge of the Sith dissection!

The movie you've all been waiting for is here!
Plinkett's REVENGE OF THE SITH review is up.
Does he kill again?
Will he finally finish his plate of pizza rolls?
Can we at last put this behind us?
 
In my opinion, it's waaaay too long.
It might actually be as long as a STAR WARS film.
 
Anyway, I think a lot of it is funny.
Feel free to discuss and critique in the Talkbacks below.
