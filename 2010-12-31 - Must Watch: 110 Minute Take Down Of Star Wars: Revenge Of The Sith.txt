Must Watch: 110 Minute Take Down Of Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith

It has been far, far too long since we last heard from Mr. Plinkett and Red Letter Media.
For those that don't remember, Plinkett is the online critic who broke out onto the scene this time last year with a 70-minute review of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
In addition to being incredibly in depth and informative, taking the viewer both through the film minute-by-minute and behind the production, the video was also screamingly hilarious, if not totally fucked up (Plinkett also happens to be a psychotic serial killer who keeps women locked in his basement).
Since his Phantom Menace review, he's taken extended looks at Avatar, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of The Clones, Baby's Day Out, and J.J. Abrams' Star Trek.
Now we have the video that we've all been waiting for: Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.

This time clocking in at 110 minutes (longer than any previous review), the video is only half an hour shorter than the movie itself, but undoubtedly a whole lot more entertaining.
People say that Revenge of the Sith is the best of the three Star Wars prequels, but that's like saying that you prefer to eat deer feces over cow crap because you prefer the texture.
No matter what, you have a mouth full of shit.
For those new to Red Letter Media reviews, you may tell yourself that you won't watch the whole thing, but you shouldn't start unless you have your schedule cleared, because you will be watching your computer screen for 110 minutes.
Check out the video, split into three parts, below.
