Last December, Red Letter Media delivered a scathing 70-minute review of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.
The epic review, which at times veered into odd obsessions over pizza rolls and dead hookers but mostly made astute and intelligent points about the reviled prequel, was greeted with cheers.
This past April, RLM delivered a 90-minute dissertation on the many failings of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.
Now, on the last day of 2010, RLM has a whopping 110 minute review of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.
I haven’t had a chance to watch it yet, but if the previous installments are any indication of quality, I’m in for a hilarious and insightful review that’s almost as long as the movie it’s reviewing.

Hit the jump to check out the epic review.
