This guy is enough of an Internet phenomenon that I assume I don’t have to introduce him.
Longtime HA readers, at least, are already familiar with his reviews of “The Phantom Menace” and “Attack of the Clones,” so you should know by now that you’re in for something special here.
I sat down thinking I’d give the first clip 10 minutes and then go about my New Year’s Eve business; two hours later, I was still there watching clip three.
This is, quite simply, the best thing you’ll watch all day, notwithstanding the various TV marathons going on around the dial.
If you can’t spare hours, at least watch the third video for the “Citizen Kane” comparison and insights into Lucas’s crippling addiction to F/X at the expense of storytelling.

As always, the language is zesty, so please observe your official content warning.
