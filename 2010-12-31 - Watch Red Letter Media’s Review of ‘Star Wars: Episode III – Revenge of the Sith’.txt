Watch Red Letter Media’s Review of ‘Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith’

Close out 2010 with a 110-minute takedown of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.
The first part of Red Letter Media’s feature-length review series hit almost exactly a year ago, the second in April, and now the cycle is complete.
And while this review still has the flat ‘creepy guy in his basement’ aspects of the first two reviews, it also has the same in-depth breakdown of the movie.
Check out the review after the break.

As with the previous prequel reviews, the criticism here boils down to “what’s at stake, and why should I care?” Amid all the silly jokes and snarky attacks, there’s a solid approach to the movie and the characters within.
Sadly, this is the sort of screenwriting workshop that should have taken place before the film was shot, but it’ll do as a piece of post-release criticism.
