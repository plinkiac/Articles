Mike Stoklasa made Filmmaker‘s “25 New Faces” list in 2010 with his brilliant feature-length critical vivisections of George Lucas’s Star Wars prequel series.
First there was The Phantom Menace, and then Attack of the Clones, and now Stoklasa, in his “Mr. Plinkett” persona, tackles Revenge of the Sith.
Watch, marvel and enjoy.
