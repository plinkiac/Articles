Another Super-Long Star Wars Review
https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/another-super-long-star-wars-review/

Mr. Plinkett is back with another insanely-thorough (and almost two-hour) review of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.
Yes, that film came out in 2005, but like a fine wine or a sh*tty scotch, Mr. Plinkettâ€™s reviews take that long to mature.
As always, I could do without the Larry Flynt shtick, but entertaining nonetheless.
