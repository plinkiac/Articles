The Trilogy is Complete!

About a year ago, this guy with a funny voice calling himself Mr. Plinkett released a seven-part review demolishing The Phantom Menace in hilarious fashion.
The character of Plinkett is depicted as an impossibly old, alcoholic murderer with a keen sense of filmic storytelling and his reviews could be taught in a film theory class if not for the rampant swearing and references to violence against women.
Prior to “Menace,” Plinkett had done similarly brilliant but more straight-forward reviews of the Next Gen Star Trek movies, but it was the first Star Wars review that put him on the radar.

Over the course of the year, Mr. Plinkett, the alter-ego of Wisconsin-based filmmaker Mike Stoklasa, released an Attack of the Clones review (equally hysterical) as well as a review of Baby’s Day Out, Avatar, and J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek (aka, “Star Trek: The Star Trek”), but everyone was clambering for the inevitable finale to the prequel bashing.
Today, my dear friends, is the day.
Plinkett’s Revenge of the Sith review is a scathing, bleak condemnation of not only the film and its many shortcomings but also of Lucas’ constant need to fuck with his own past brilliance.

I don’t know what Plinkett has in store for us in the future, but I’ll be there.

Check out the new review at Red Letter Media’s website where you can also find stuff about their first feature film, the funny, gory horror flick “Feeding Frenzy.”
