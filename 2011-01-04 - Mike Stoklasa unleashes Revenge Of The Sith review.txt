Mike Stoklasa unleashes Revenge Of The Sith review

Whether you feel that the much-maligned Star Wars prequels were childhood-defiling, CGI-riddled atrocities, or simply cinematic affronts to all that is good, pure, and holy in the world, there’s something strangely enjoyable about wallowing in their stunning awfulness.
Perhaps no one knows this better than Mike Stoklasa, a Milwaukee filmmaker who became an Internet sensation in late 2009 with his hilariously eviscerating, painfully thorough video review of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
Now, just more than a year later, the armchair über-critic has posted his takedown of George Lucas’ final prequel, Revenge Of The Sith.
Cue the stiff acting and brief cameo from Jimmy Smits!
When The A.V. Club talked to Stoklasa last April, he had just finished up his review of Episode II: Attack Of The Clones, and was enjoying the fringe benefits of Internet fame.
(“Things like V.I.P access to all the hottest nightclubs, the private jets, women, drugs...Oh, wait, none of that’s true.”)
This time around, a few well-respected fans have voiced their delight.
No less an authority on film than Roger Ebert recently Tweeted that the Episode III review could be “the first movie review people might pay $10 for to see in a theater.”
We agree, especially since the three-part, nearly two hour-long video is only 20 minutes shorter than the very film it’s reviewing.
As much as we enjoy Stoklasa’s gloriously nitpicky videos, it’s nice to see him finally close the book on this dark, Jar Jar-sullied period in geek-cinema history.
As for possible reviews of other Star Wars detritus—those Ewok movies from the ’80s, that crappy Clone Wars cartoon—we can only advise him to keep his distance, without looking like he’s trying to keep his distance.
We don’t know.
Fly casual.
