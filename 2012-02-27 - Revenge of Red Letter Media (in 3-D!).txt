Thirty-five years ago, George Lucas released a film that changed the way movies were made.
Thirteen years ago, George Lucas released a film that changed the way fans behaved on the Internet.
Three years ago, Milwaukee’s Red Letter Media took it upon itself to offer a scathing criticism of The Phantom Menace.
The so-called “Mr. Plinkett” video went beyond the usual “Jar Jar sux!” and “Lucas raped my childhood!” level of criticism, and into something both savagely funny and thought-provoking.
The A.V. Club recently stood in line with Red Letter Media’s Mike Stoklasa for the 3-D re-release of The Phantom Menace to discuss life as an Internet sensation and what the future holds for Red Letter Media.

The A.V. Club: Has Lucasfilm ever contacted you?

Mike Stoklasa: I received a crank call from Rick McCallum once. He said, “What is it with Mikes?” and hung up. I heard George Lucas laughing in the background, too. It was awesome. The call was so dense—every second had something going on in it!

AVC: What’s been the most amusing reaction to your prequel videos from a fan?

MS: A guy wrote a 108-page response to the Phantom Menace review, citing how I was wrong about all of my opinions. He then went on to explain how the audience “should have known” all these mysterious facts and leaps of logic. I didn’t read the whole thing, but I’ve seen snippets, and he didn’t seem to get the obvious parts where I was joking about something. He probably goes on a lot of dates and is a big hit with the ladies.

I’ve also received a lot of really nice e-mails from people saying how they look at their own writing or films differently after watching my reviews—which is neat to have made some kind of positive impact, especially from a horrible person like me.
