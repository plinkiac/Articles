LOL: Red Letter Media Has Questions About ‘Prometheus’
https://www.slashfilm.com/lol-red-letter-media-questions-prometheus/

Red Letter Media, best known for their brilliant and funny dissections of George Lucas’ Star Wars prequels, has just posted a hilarious video talking about Ridley Scott‘s Prometheus.
Since they don’t have the movie itself to draw clips from, the video is just one guy frying his friends brain with four straight minutes of unanswered questions and plot holes from the film.
Some are easily answered, others are not, but they’re all really humorous.
Check out the video below.

Congrats once again to Red Letter Media for another winner.
Apparently, this was originally 30 minutes longer but got edited down. I say post the whole thing.

Obviously, this is nothing but major spoilers.

EDIT – It was pointed out that the full review of the film is here.
