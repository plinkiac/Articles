9. The a-holes talking about films (Sept. 29-Oct. 10 at various locations)
Writing about music may or may not be like dancing about architecture, but talking about films remains a vital exercise for casual movie fans and cinema geeks alike.
This year’s panel discussions—most of which take place in Kenilworth Square East—include talks on film distribution, financing, and ethics in documentary filmmaking.
But our choice for can’t-miss panel is “Three A-Holes Talk About Web Videos” (Oct. 6 at Y-Not III).
Three Milwaukee filmmakers—Funny Or Die’s Jack Packard; and Red Letter Media’s Mike Stoklasa and Jay Bauman (of those epic Star Wars prequel takedowns)—will sit down with Gal Friday Films’ Kara Mulrooney to discuss forging a filmmaking career on this crazy thing we call the “Internet.”
Bonus feature: Former Village Voice film critic J. Hoberman will be in town to discuss his new book Film After Film: (Or, What Became Of 21st Century Cinema?), as well as screen the David Lynch opus Inland Empire.
