[1. You LOVE Terrible Things]

If I know one thing about the Internet, it's cats.
If I know a second thing, it's that it loves to watch and make fun of bad things.
You love it.
You loved not liking Prometheus.
Everyone was nerds to the wall excited about The Dark Knight Rises, and then disappointed.
But then we all had a Bane-voiced ball making fun of it.
It was fun.
You had fun.
Admit it.
You like bad movies as much as you like good movies.

Personally, I would love to see another great Star Wars film.
I would love to make a great Star Wars film.
It's possible.
We've already covered how not to make a Star Wars sequel.
But now that we know what NOT to do, we can do it right.
But if that doesn't happen, at least I'll get to watch a two-hour video of Harry Plinkett making fun of the new terrible Star Wars movie on Red Letter Media.
I'll take that.
I'll take it with a smile, even if Greedo smiled first.
