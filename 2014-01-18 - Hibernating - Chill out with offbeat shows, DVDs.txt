Hibernating? Chill out with offbeat shows, DVDs
https://archive.vn/vzOFj (dailyherald.com)

We've had our share of frigid days and snowy nights this winter, times when you just want to curl up on the couch instead of heading into the bitter cold.
For those kind of days -- and we're sure there will be more -- we have a few recommendations for shows, movies and Internet videos sure to warm up a night at home.
All are available on either DVD, Netflix or online.

So grab a blanket, order some takeout and settle in for a night of chills, thrills and well-earned laughs.

A group of filmmakers and obsessive film-watchers in Wisconsin who first rose to Internet prominence with their hilarious dissections of the "Star Wars" prequels, Red Letter Media has a wealth of wonderful videos on its website and YouTube channel.

The most entertaining is the regular series called "Best of the Worst," in which a panel incredulously watches and discusses three terrible movies.
Episode 7, for example, includes a "Die Hard" rip-off inexplicably marketed as a "Home Alone" rip-off, and a British kids' movie called "Thunderpants" about a boy with excessive flatulence.
(I'm sure Rupert Grint of "Harry Potter" fame is proud to have that on his resume.)

Search "Red Letter Media" on YouTube, grab a couple of beers and make sure the kids aren't around.
