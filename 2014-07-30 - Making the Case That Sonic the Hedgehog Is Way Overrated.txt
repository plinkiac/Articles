All that love for the early Sonic The Hedgehog games may be very misplaced, according to some gentlemen who recently revisited them.
They even go so far to say that they're fundamentally flawed.

This episode of Red Letter Media's Previously Recorded webseries takes aim at the first few Sonic titles, picking apart the origins of Sega's mascot and how, in the opinion of hosts Jack Packard and Rich Evans, the gameplay fails to live up to the hype.
"Sonic will never be great because he never was great."
Harsh.
