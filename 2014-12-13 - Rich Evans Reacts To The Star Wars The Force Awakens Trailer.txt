Rich Evans Reacts To The Star Wars: The Force Awakens Trailer

I wasn't going to post any more of these trailer recreation vids, but this one made me laugh heartily so I figured what the heck.
We've already seen Mr. Plinkett's reaction to The Force Awakens footage, now see what his Red Letter Media alter ego (kinda) Rich Evans makes of it..

Rich Evans does not actually provide the voice for Mr. Plinkett in his infamous video reviews, but he does play him in the Red Letter Media "Half In The Bag" review segments...with me so far?
Anyway, it doesn't matter -- all you need to know is that he's a big Star Wars fan and this past Monday he just got the chance to sit down and watch the trailer for The Force Awakens for the very first time.
This is a bit on the NSFW side for language and, er....lewd gestures.
