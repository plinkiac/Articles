Patton Oswalt on Movie Addiction, Star Wars, and the One Film He'd Watch on Loop

Have you ever watched Mr. Plinkett's Revenge of the Sith review?

Oh my God.
I have watched all of that guy's stuff.
And not just Star Wars, he goes through all the Star Trek movies and those are really instructive in terms of: Here are the horrible, cynical decisions being made and you can see right through them.
There's also a great one he does about Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was amazing.

Besides being funny, he actually does a full and really great analysis of these movies.

Here's what's also genius about it: His analysis is amazing and he knows that if he was just sitting there doing an analysis of it, it would be unwatchable.
So he goes, "Okay, I am going to do it as this character who can't say the word 'protagonist.'"
He understands how a movie works and he doesn't know what the word "protagonist" means, which is a hilarious combination of things.
Yeah, those are amazing.
That is why I always put an asterisk now next to my criticism of the prequels.
Those prequels?
Yeah, they're awful.
But they inspired a lot of amazing film scholarship that better films haven't done, which shows you the richness of the universe and how he is squandering it.
That is what is so tragic.
