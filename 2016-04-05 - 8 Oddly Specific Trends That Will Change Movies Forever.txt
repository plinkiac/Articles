[Everything's Going To Start Looking Like It Was Made In The '90s]

Hey, '90s film kids, remember all the rage-nostalgia that went into fighting the switch from film to digital? It wasn't just the look of film, but the implied deliberation and craft that goes into burning light onto an expensive film reel as opposed to doing take after take on some training-wheels 4K abomination.
We weren't just yearning for some old-timey quality because it looked old, right? Otherwise, you'd see jackasses getting all elitist over the turd-fog of gargled VHS tapes.

Okay, shit, maybe it is just blind nostalgia for an older look.
Because VHS is totally coming back in viral whims.
For example, there's the wildly successful Kung Fury short (soon to become a full-length film), which homages the look of shitty '80/'90s home video the way Tarantino and Rodriguez aped broken '70s grindhouse reels.

As someone who first saw Aliens on my best friend's TV-pirated VHS copy, I can assure you that there's nothing fun about watching the snuff-porn-quality version of your favorite movies.
And yet the more I exist, the more I see nostalgia for this irrelevant garbage format.
Even Deadpool released a new trailer done to look like one of the inescapable previews you'd fast-forward through on some grainy Hollywood Video rental.

But it's not just the quality of VHS being imitated here.
It's also the camp of the VHS era, with (albeit terrific) films like Red Letter Media's Space Cop and Turbo Kid -- the latter takes place in the "future year" of 1997.
Between this and movies like Straight Outta Compton and Dope romanticizing the fucking terrible style of the time, I wouldn't be surprised if 2016 is the year I find myself in handcuffs and arson gear outside of a JNCO revival factory.
