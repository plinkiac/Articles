What Makes a Cursed Image?

Web detritus?
Creepy, “cursed” images?
Both?

Recently, a Twitter account called @cursedimages has garnered some media attention — including write-ups in Gizmodo and The New Yorker.
The gimmick of the account is simple: It posts unattributed photos and labels each one a “cursed image.”
“Cursed image 3920” is a photo of a fiberglass-cow TV showing a news report about Saddam Hussein.
“Cursed image 31” shows four boys around a computer.

What makes an image “cursed”?
“Cursed images, to me, leave you with a general uneasy feeling,” the account’s anonymous author told Gizmodo.
“There could be certain qualities, like someone looking directly at the camera or an orb floating in the background.”

This is an appealing idea — that there is something inherent to the subjects of the photographs that makes them “cursed” — but it doesn’t quite hold up to scrutiny.
Take, for instance, @cursedimages’s interpretation of this photo, which they claim shows a lake with the “feeling” of “a kid diving too deep and never coming back up or someone seeing an unrecognizable creature swimming down with them in the depths.”
