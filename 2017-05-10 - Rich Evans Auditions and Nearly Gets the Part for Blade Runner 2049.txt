You might not know who Rich Evans is but after seeing this video he should definitely be on your radar.
While it’s tough to compete with Ryan Gosling or Harrison Ford, Evans, made a very compelling case for why he should have had a starring role in Blade Runner 2049.
Evans is one of many talented actors out there who’s just trying to make it but Evans is a special case.

Not many know this, but Rich Evans came very close to getting the lead role in Denis Villeneuve’s upcoming Blade Runner sequel.
The production company was kind enough to release the footage of Rich’s audition and needless to say he blew away all of the producers.
Personally I think it’s just a matter of time before Evans gets the lead role in a sci-fi film, or any film for that matter.
He’s that good.
