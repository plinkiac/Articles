Red Letter Media Takes Down and Breaks Down the Ghostbusters Reboot

It’s kind of amazing that Mike Stoklasa‘s creation of RedLetterMedia and the character of Harry S. Plinkett has lasted so long after first finding viral fame for a seven-part takedown of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace back in 2009.
But the internet is full of plenty of wackier things, and despite the fact that this character is supremely annoying to listen to, his video reviews do make plenty of valid points, even if they are combined with some really lame attempts at humor.

While Star Wars has become a prime target for Harry S. Plinkett, every now and then he turns his attention to a movie that garnered a lot of attention from passionate fans and viewers.
The Ghostbusters reboot from 2016 (or Ghostbusters: Answer the Call as it’s more officially titled) was certainly one of those movies, and even though it’s been over a year since it was released and most of us have moved on, Harry S. Plinkett has a one-hour takedown and breakdown of the film directed by Paul Feig.
