Macaulay Culkin: Surprising appearance on YouTube critics

While many fans of the "Kevin" movies still hope that Macaulay Culkin will eventually reappear in a larger film role, the actor prefers a different path.
He just lives his life from the Kevin Coal and appears here and there in a sketch, a wrestling ring or headlines on Twitter.
Now Culkin has again caused a surprise and suddenly sits in the movie critic show "Half in the Bag".

"Half in the Bag" is a format by Red Letter Media, a moderately successful production company that has been publishing humorous and highly competent film reviews on YouTube for years.
And, after all, the video essays about "Star Wars" that were completely entrusted to fans.
What is the meanwhile 38-year-old Culkin looking for there?
Well, he's simply a fan of Red Letter Media's team, years ago he had a bizarre guest appearance in a format of critics and sacrificed DVDs of children's actors to preserve his youth.

Now Culkin has again appeared at Red Letter Media, as a guest he is in the discussion of "Halloween" here.
And again, his appearance is relatively meaningless: In a storyline that has been going on for 150 episodes (!) and that was knit around the film reviews, and in which two critics allegedly repair a video recorder, Culkin suddenly plays the new boss of the protagonists.
So he sits on the edge of the action for 30 minutes, takes notes and sometimes laughs.
Only not with the obligatory "Kevin" joke at minute 24:00.
